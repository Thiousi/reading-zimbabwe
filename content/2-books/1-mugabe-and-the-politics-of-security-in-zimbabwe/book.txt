Synopsis: 

In 1980, the newly independent and democratic Zimbabwe was a beacon of hope
in a troubled region. Three decades later, Zimbabwe became the focus of
international attention for very different reasons: acrimonious racial relations,
controversial elections, economic hardship, and military intervention in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mugabe and the Politics of Security in
Zimbabwe argues that this unfortunate transition is intrinsically linked to the
ways in which President Robert Mugabe used the politics of domestic and
external security for his own gain. Abiodun Alao presents a comprehensive study
of defense institutions, domestic security policy, and external use of military
force during Mugabe's decades of rule. He identifies the role of personality in
security and explains how the machinations of a self-perpetuating ruler shaped
the economic and political dynamics of the struggling nation. He also provides
analytical perspectives on Mugabe's transformations from a freedom fighter to a
stable president of a relatively economically strong, independent country, and
finally to an imprudent autocrat and international pariah.

Nuanced, impassioned, and timely, Mugabe and the Politics of Security in
Zimbabwe sheds new light on the effects of national security policy and develops
a clear picture of the country's past, present, and future.
